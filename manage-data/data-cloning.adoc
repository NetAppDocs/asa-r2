Clone storage units and consistency groups to create data copies that can be used in isolation from your production data for a variety of purposes such as application development and testing or backups.

== Clone storage units
Clone storage units to create point-in-time, writable copies of your production data.  Use storage unit clones for essential enterprise operations such as application development and testing or provisioning of server and desktop images. 

.Steps

Storage units can be cloned from your source storage VMs or from storage VMs that have been replicated to remote destinations.

. Select *Storage*.
. Hover over the name of the storage unit you want to clone.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Clone*.
. Enter the name of the new storage unit that will be created as a clone.
. Select the host mapping.

A new snapshot is created for the clone by default.  
. If you want to use an existing snapshot or if you want to split the clone, select *More Options* the complete the necessary steps.

== Clone consistency groups

Clone a consistency group to create a new consistency group thatâ€™s identical in structure, storage units, and data to the consistency group being cloned. Use a clone to perform application testing or to migrate data.  Suppose, for example, you need to migrate a production workload out of a consistency group.  You can clone the consistency group to create a copy of your production workload to maintain as a backup until the migration is complete.

The clone is created from a snapshot of the original consistency group.  By default, the snapshot used for the clone is taken at the point in time that the cloning process is initiated. You can modify the default behavior to use a pre-existing snapshot. 

You can also choose to create a new host group or add new hosts to the clone when it is created.

Storage unit mappings are not copied as part of the cloning process.  After the clone is created, you must map storage units as needed.

.Steps

. Select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the consistency group you want to clone.
. Select image:icon_kaboob.gif[three vertical blue dots], then select *Clone*.
. Enter a name for the new, cloned consistency group or accept the default name.
. Select the host operating system and host mapping.
. If you want to dissociate the clone from the source consistency group and allocate disk space, select *Split clone*.
. If you want to use an existing snapshot, create a new host group or add a new host for the clone, select *More Options*.
