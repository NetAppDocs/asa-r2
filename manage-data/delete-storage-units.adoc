Delete a storage unit if you no longer need to maintain the data contained in the unit.  Deleting storage units that are no longer needed can help you free space needed for other host applications.

.Before you begin
If the storage unit you want to delete is in a consistency group that is in replication relationship, you must link:../data-protection/manage-consistency-groups.html#remove-a-storage-unit-from-a-consistency-group[remove the storage unit from the consistency group] before you delete it.  

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Storage*.
. Hover over the name of the storage unit you want to delete.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Delete*.
. Acknowledge that the deletion cannot be undone.
. Select *Delete*.

.What's next?

Reallocate the space you freed by deleting the storage unit to storage units that need additional capacity.  You can link:../manage-data/modify-storage-units.html#edit-storage-units[edit existing storage units] to increase their size.
