= Modify storage units on ASA r2 storage systems

[.lead]
To optimize performance on your ASA r2 system, you might need to modify your storage units to increase their capacity, update QoS policies or to change the hosts that are mapped to the units. For example, if a new, critical application workload is added to an existing storage unit, you might need to change the Quality of Service (QoS) policy applied to the storage unit to support the performance level needed for the new application.

.Increase capacity
Increase the size of a storage unit before it reaches full capacity to prevent a loss of data access that can occur if the storage unit runs out of writeable space.  The capacity of a storage unit can be increased to 128 TB which is the maximum size allowed by ONTAP.

.Modify host mappings
Modify the hosts that are mapped to a storage unit to assist in balancing workloads or reconfiguring system resources.


.Modify QoS policy
Quality of service (QoS) policies guarantee that the performance of critical workloads is not degraded by competing workloads. You can use QoS policies to set a QoS throughput _limit_ and a QoS throughput _guarantee_.  

* QoS throughput limit
+
The QoS throughput _limit_ restricts the impact of a workload on system resources by limiting the throughput for the workload to a maximum number of IOPS or MBps, or IOPS and MBps. 

* QoS throughput guarantee
+
The QoS throughput _guarantee_ ensures that critical workloads meet minimum throughput targets, regardless of demand by competing workloads, by guaranteeing that the throughput for the critical workload does not fall below a minimum number of IOPS or MBps, or IOPS and MBps. 

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Storage*.
. Hover over the name of the storage unit you want to edit.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Edit*.
. Update the storage unit parameters as needed to increase capacity, change the QoS policy, and update the host mapping.

.What's next?

If you have increased the size of your storage unit, you must rescan the storage unit on the host for the host to recognize the change in size.
