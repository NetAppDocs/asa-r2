[.lead]
When you provision storage, you ensure that your SAN hosts can read from and write data to ASA r2 storage systems. To provision storage, you  use ONTAP System Manager to create storage units, add host initiators, and map the host to a storage unit. You also have to perform steps on the host to enable read/write operations.

== Step 1: Create storage units

In ASA r2, a storage unit makes storage space available to your SAN hosts for data operations. A storage unit refers to a LUN for SCSI hosts or an NVMe namespace for NVMe hosts. If your cluster is configured to support SCSI hosts, you are prompted to create a LUN. If your cluster is configured to support NVMe hosts, you are prompted to create an NVMe namespace. An ASA r2 storage unit has a maximum capacity of 128TB.  

See link:https://hwu.netapp.com/[NetApp Hardware Universe^] for the most current ASA r2 storage limits.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Storage*; then select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[rectangular icon with blue background and the word add centered in white letters].

. Enter a name for the new storage unit.

. Enter the number of units you want to create.

. Enter the storage unit capacity; then select the host operating system, format and mapping.
+
If you create more than one storage unit, each unit is created with the same capacity, host operating system, format and mapping. 

. If you want to do any of the following, select *More Options* and complete the required steps.

| Option
| Steps 

a| Change the default Quality of Service (QoS) policy
+
If the default QoS policy has not previously been set on the storage virtual machine (VM) on which the storage unit is being created, this option is not available.
a| 
.. Under *Storage and optimization*, next to *Quality of service (QoS)*, select image:icon_dropdown_arrow.gif[icon of blue arrow pointing in downward direction] .
.. Select an existing QoS policy.

a| Create a new QoS policy
a|
.. Under *Storage and optimization*, next to *Quality of service (QoS)*, select image:icon_dropdown_arrow.gif[icon of blue arrow pointing in downward direction] .
.. Select *Define new policy*.
.. Enter the policy parameters; then select *Add*.

a| Add a new SCSI host
a|
.. Under *Host information*, select *SCSI* for the connection protocol.
.. Select the host operating system.
.. Under *Host Mapping*, select *New hosts*.
.. Select *FC* or *iSCSI*.
.. Select existing host initiators or select *Add initiator* to add a new host initiator.
+
An example of a valid FC WWPN is "01:02:03:04:0a:0b:0c:0d". Examples of valid iSCSI initiator names are "iqn.1995-08.com.example:string" and "eui.0123456789abcdef".

a| Create a new SCSI host group

a| 
.. Under *Host information*, select *SCSI* for the connection protocol.
.. Select the host operating system.
.. Under *Host Mapping*, select *New host group*. 
.. Enter a name for the host group; then select the hosts to add to the group.


a| Add a new NVMe subsystem
a|
.. Under *Host information*, select *NVMe* for the connection protocol.
.. Select the host operating system.
.. Under *Host Mapping*, select *New NVMe subsystem*.
.. Enter a name for the subsystem or accept the default name.
.. Enter a name for the initiator.
.. If you want to enable In-band authentication or TLS, select image:icon_dropdown_arrow.gif[icon of blue arrow pointing in downward direction]; then select your options.
.. Select *+ Add initiator* to add more initiators.
+
The host NQN should be formatted as <nqn.yyyy-mm.> followed by a fully qualified domain name. The year should be equal to or later than 1970. The total maximum length should be 223. An example of a valid NVMe initiator is nqn.2014-08.com.example:string

// table end

. Select *Add*.

.Result
Your storage units are created.

.What's next?

If you have not added your host initiators, you should add them now.  If you have added your host initiators, you are ready to map the storage unit to the host.

== Step 2: Add host initiators

In addition to creating ASA r2 storage units, you need to add host initiators to your SAN hosts. These initiators make the hosts eligible to access storage units and perform data operations.

Add host initiators for SCSI or NVMe hosts.

.Steps

. Select *Host*.
. Select *SCSI*; then select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[icon of blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters].
. Enter the host name, select the host operating system and enter a host description.
. If you want to replicate the host configuration to a destination cluster, select *Replicate host configuration*; then select the destination cluster.
+
Your cluster must be in a replication relationship to replicate the host configuration.
. Add new or existing hosts.

| Add new hosts
| Add existing hosts

a| 
.. Select *New hosts*.
.. Select *FC* or *iSCSI*; then select the host initiators.
.. Optionally, select *Configure host proximity*.
+
Configuring host proximity enables ONTAP to identify the controller nearest to the host for data path optimization and latency reduction.  This is only applicable if you have replicated data to a remote location.  If you have not setup snapshot replication, you do not need to select this option.

.. If you need to add new initiators, select *Add initiators*.

a|
.. Select *Existing hosts*.
.. Select the host you want to add.
.. Select *Add*.

// table end
|===

. Select *Add*.

.What's next?

Your SCSI hosts are added to your ASA r2 system and you are ready to map your hosts to your storage units.
--

.NVMe hosts
--
.Steps

. Select *Host*.
. Select *NVMe*; then select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[rectangular icon with blue background and the word add centered in white letters].
. Enter a name for the NVMe subsystem, select the host operating system and enter a description.
. Select *Add initiator*.

.What's next?

Your NVMe hosts are added to your ASA r2 system and you are ready to map your hosts to your storage units.

// end tabbed area


== Step 3: Map the storage unit to a host

After you have created your ASA r2 storage units, and added host initiators, you need to map your hosts to your storage units to begin serving data. SCSI hosts can access only the storage units to which they are mapped. All NVMe hosts in an NVMe subsystem can access all storage units in the subsystem.

.Steps

. Select *Storage*.
. Hover over the name of the storage unit you want to map.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Map to hosts*.
. Select the hosts you want to map to the storage unit; then select *Map*.

.What's next?

Your storage unit is mapped to your hosts and you are ready to complete the provisioning process on your hosts.

== Step 4: Complete host-side provisioning

There are steps you must perform on your hosts before the hosts can read and write data on your ASA r2.

.Steps

. For FC and FC/NVMe, zone your FC switches by WWPN. 
+
Use one zone per initiator and include all target ports in each zone.
. Discover the new storage unit.
. Initialize the storage unit and a create file system.
. Verify that your host can read and write data on the storage unit.

.What's next?

You have completed the provisioning process and are ready to begin serving data.  You can now link:data-protection/create-snapshots.html[create snapshots] to protect the data on your ASA r2.
