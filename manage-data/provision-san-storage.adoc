When you provision storage, you enable your SAN hosts to read from and write data to ASA r2 storage systems. To provision storage, you use ONTAP System Manager to create storage units, add host initiators, and map the host to a storage unit. You also need to perform steps on the host to enable read/write operations.

== Create storage units

On an ASA r2 system, a storage unit makes storage space available to your SAN hosts for data operations. A storage unit refers to a LUN for SCSI hosts or an NVMe namespace for NVMe hosts. If your cluster is configured to support SCSI hosts, you are prompted to create a LUN. If your cluster is configured to support NVMe hosts, you are prompted to create an NVMe namespace. An ASA r2 storage unit has a maximum capacity of 128 TB.  

See the link:https://hwu.netapp.com/[NetApp Hardware Universe^] for the most current storage limits for ASA r2 systems.

Host initiators are added and mapped to the storage unit as part of the storage unit creation process.  You can also link:provision-san-storage.html#add-host-initiators[add host initiators] and link:provision-san-storage.html#map-the-storage-unit-to-a-host[map] them to your storage units after the storage units are created.

Beginning with ONTAP 9.18.1, you can modify the snapshot reserve and enable automatic snapshot deletion when you create a storage unit.  The snapshot reserve is the amount of space in the storage unit reserved specifically for snapshots.  When snapshot reserve is set with automatic snapshot deletion, older snapshots are automatically deleted when space used by snapshots exceeds the snapshot reserve.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Storage*; then select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[rectangular icon with blue background and the word add centered in white letters].

. Enter a name for the new storage unit.

. Enter the number of units you want to create.
+
If you create more than one storage unit, each unit is created with the same capacity, host operating system, and host mapping. 

. Enter the storage unit capacity; then select the host operating system.

. Accept the auto-selected *host mapping* or select a different host group for the storage unit to be mapped to.
+
*Host mapping* refers to the host group that the new storage unit will be mapped to. If there is a pre-existing host group for the type of host you selected for your new storage unit, the pre-existing host group is auto-selected for your host mapping.  You can accept the host group that is auto-selected or you can select a different host group.  
+
If there is no pre-existing host group for hosts running on the operating system you specified, ONTAP automatically creates a new host group.

. If you want to do any of the following, select *More Options* and complete the required steps.

| Option
| Steps 

// New row 
a| Change the default Quality of Service (QoS) policy

If the default QoS policy has not previously been set on the storage virtual machine (VM) on which the storage unit is being created, this option is not available.
a| 
.. Under *Storage and optimization*, next to *Quality of service (QoS)*, select image:icon_dropdown_arrow.gif[icon of blue arrow pointing in downward direction].
.. Select an existing QoS policy.

// New row
a| Create a new QoS policy
a|
.. Under *Storage and optimization*, next to *Quality of service (QoS)*, select image:icon_dropdown_arrow.gif[icon of blue arrow pointing in downward direction] .
.. Select *Define new policy*.
.. Enter a name for the new QoS policy.
.. Set a QoS limit, a QoS guarantee, or both.
... Optionally, under *Limit*, enter a maximum throughput limit, a maximum IOPS limit, or both.
+
Setting a maximum throughput and IOPS for a storage unit restricts its impact on system resources so that it does not degrade the performance of critical workloads.
... Optionally, under *Guarantee*, enter a minimum throughput, a minimum IOPS, or both.
+
Setting a minimum throughput and IOPS for a storage unit guarantees that it meets minimum performance targets regardless of demand by competing workloads. 

.. Select *Add*.

// New row
a| Change the default performance service level. 

a| .. Under *Storage and optimization*, next to the *Performance service level*, select image:icon_dropdown_arrow.gif[icon of blue arrow pointing in downward direction].
.. Select *Performance*.
+
ASA r2 systems offer two performance levels.  The default performance level is *Extreme*, which is the highest available level.  You can lower the level to *Performance*.

// New row
a| Modify the default snapshot reserve and enable automatic snapshot deletion.
a|
.. Under *Snapshot reserve %*, enter the numeric value for the percentage of the storage unit space you want to allocate to snapshots.
.. Select *Automatically delete older snapshots*.

// New row
a| Add a new SCSI host
a|
.. Under *Host information*, select *SCSI* for the connection protocol.
.. Select the host operating system.
.. Under *Host Mapping*, select *New hosts*.
.. Select *FC* or *iSCSI*.
.. Select existing host initiators or select *Add initiator* to add a new host initiator.
+
An example of a valid FC WWPN is "01:02:03:04:0a:0b:0c:0d". Examples of valid iSCSI initiator names are "iqn.1995-08.com.example:string" and "eui.0123456789abcdef".

// New row
a| Create a new SCSI host group

a| 
.. Under *Host information*, select *SCSI* for the connection protocol.
.. Select the host operating system.
.. Under *Host Mapping*, select *New host group*. 
.. Enter a name for the host group; then select the hosts to add to the group.

// New row
a| Add a new NVMe subsystem
a|
.. Under *Host information*, select *NVMe* for the connection protocol.
.. Select the host operating system.
.. Under *Host Mapping*, select *New NVMe subsystem*.
.. Enter a name for the subsystem or accept the default name.
.. Enter a name for the initiator.
.. If you want to enable in-band authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), select image:icon_dropdown_arrow.gif[icon of blue arrow pointing in downward direction]; then select your options.
+
In-band authentication allows secure bidirectional and unidirectional authentication between your NVMe hosts and your ASA r2 system.
+
TLS encrypts all data sent over the network between your NVMe/TCP hosts and your ASA r2 system.
.. Select *Add initiator* to add more initiators.
+
The host NQN should be formatted as <nqn.yyyy-mm> followed by a fully qualified domain name. The year should be equal to or later than 1970. The total maximum length should be 223. An example of a valid NVMe initiator is nqn.2014-08.com.example:string

.What's next?

Your storage units are created and mapped to your hosts. You can now link:../data-protection/create-snapshots.html[create snapshots] to protect the data on your ASA r2 system.

.For more information

Learn more about link:../administer/manage-client-vm-access.html[how ASA r2 systems use storage virtual machines].

== Add host initiators

You can add new host initiators to your ASA r2 system at any time. Initiators make the hosts eligible to access storage units and perform data operations. 

.Before you begin

If you want to replicate the host configuration to a destination cluster during the process of adding your host initiators, your cluster must be in a replication relationship.  Optionally, you can link:../data-protection/snapshot-replication.html#step-3-create-a-replication-relationship[create a replication relationship] after your host is added.

Add host initiators for SCSI or NVMe hosts.

== Map the storage unit to a host

After you have created your ASA r2 storage units and added host initiators, you need to map your hosts to your storage units to begin serving data. Storage units are mapped to hosts as part of the storage unit creation process.  You can also map existing storage units to new or existing hosts at any time.

.Steps

. Select *Storage*.
. Hover over the name of the storage unit you want to map.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Map to hosts*.
. Select the hosts you want to map to the storage unit; then select *Map*.

.What's next?

Your storage unit is mapped to your hosts and you are ready to complete the provisioning process on your hosts.

== Complete host-side provisioning

After you have created your storage units, added your host initiators and mapped your storage units, there are steps you must perform on your hosts before they can read and write data on your ASA r2 system.

.Steps

. For FC and FC/NVMe, zone your FC switches by WWPN. 
+
Use one zone per initiator and include all target ports in each zone.
. Discover the new storage unit.
. Initialize the storage unit and a create file system.
. Verify that your host can read and write data on the storage unit.

.What's next?

You have completed the provisioning process and are ready to begin serving data.  You can now link:../data-protection/create-snapshots.html[create snapshots] to protect the data on your ASA r2 system.
