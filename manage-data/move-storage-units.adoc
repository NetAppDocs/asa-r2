If a storage availability zone is running low on space, you can move storage units to another storage availability zone to balance the storage utilization across the cluster.

You can move a storage unit while the storage unit is online and serving data.  The move operation is non-disruptive. 

.Before you begin

* You must be running ONTAP 9.16.1 or later. 
* Your cluster must consist of four or more nodes.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Storage*; then select the storage unit you want to move.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Move*.
. Select the storage availability zone you want to move the storage unit to; then select *Move*.
