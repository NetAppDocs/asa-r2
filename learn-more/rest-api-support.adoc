[.lead]
The ASA r2 REST API is based on the REST API provided with the unified ONTAP personality, with a number of changes adapted to the unique characteristics and capabilities of the ASA r2 personality.

== Summary of ASA r2 changes

There are several areas of the ASA r2 product that differ from unified ONTAP. Many of these differences impact the REST API and its use. The major differences between ASA r2 systems and FAS, AFF, and ASA systems relevant to the REST API are described below.

// FS 8.6, 8.11; DG 1,2
.Default SVM creation with protocol services
The ASA r2 system is deployed in a homogenous two-node cluster with an active-active configuration. New clusters automatically contain a default data SVM with the SAN protocols enabled. The IP data LIFs use the `default-data-blocks` service policy by default, hosting both iSCSI and NVMe/TCP.

// FS 8.1, 8.2; DG 4
.Removal of aggregates and volumes
ASA r2 systems do not enable direct management of aggregates and volumes. Creating a LUN or namespace automatically provisions a volume using balanced placement to determine the hosting sub-aggregate. Deleting a LUN or namespace automatically deletes the volume.

// FS 8.1; DG 5
.Changes to LUN and NVMe namespace naming
Provisioning a LUN or NVMe namespace maps directly to a new volume. This results in a simplified and common namespace. The `/vol` prefix used in the path with unified ONTAP has been removed.

// FS 8.10
.New block volume resource
A new block-volume endpoint has been added to the REST API for ASA r2 systems. The block-volume endpoint provides access to both LUN and NVMe namespace objects, enabling an aggregated view of the resources. This is only available through the REST API.

// FS 8.4; DG 3
.Changes to thin versus thick provisioning
The virtual disks are always exposed to external hosts as thinly provisioned. Unlike the ASA and unified ONTAP personalities, there is no option to change this behavior.

== Types of API changes

There are several differences between the ASA r2 system REST API and the REST API available with FAS, AFF, and ASA systems. The changes generally fall into one of several categories. Understanding the types of changes will help you better utilize the online API reference documentation.

.New ASA r2 endpoints not supported in unified ONTAP
Several endpoints have been added to the ASA r2 REST API which are not available with unified ONTAP. For example, *storage units* provides an aggregated view of the LUNs and NVMe namespaces. There are several endpoints and they're all based on or derived from `/api/storage/storage-units`. You should also review `/api/storage/luns` and `/api/storage/namespaces`.

// Spec 89
.Restrictions on the HTTP methods used for an existing endpoint
Several endpoints available with ASA r2 have restrictions on which HTTP methods can be used as compared with unified ONTAP. For example, POST and DELETE are not allowed when using the endpoint `/api/protocols/nvme/services` with ASA r2 systems.

// Spec 115
.Property changes for an endpoint and HTTP method
Some ASA r2 system endpoints and method combinations do not support all the defined properties available in the unified ONTAP personality. For example, when using PATCH with the endpoint `api/storage/volumes/{uuid}`, several properties are not supported with ASA r2, including:

* `autosize.maximum`
* `autosize.minimum`
* `autosize.mode`

// Spec 106
.Changes to internal processing
There are several changes to how ASA r2 processes certain REST API requests. For example, a DELETE request with the endpoint `/api/storage/luns/{uuid}` is processed asynchronously.

== Enhanced security with OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is the industry standard authorization framework. It is used to restrict and control access to protected resources based on signed access tokens. You can configure OAuth 2.0 using System Manager to protect ASA r2 system resources.

After OAuth 2.0 is set up with System Manager, access by the REST API clients can be controlled. You need to first obtain an access token from an authorization server. The REST client then passes the token to the ASA r2 cluster as a bearer token using the HTTP authorization request header. See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/authentication/overview-oauth2.html[Authentication and authorization using OAuth 2.0^] for more information.

== Access the ASA r2 API reference documentation through the Swagger UI

You can access the REST API reference documentation through the Swagger UI at your ASA r2 system.

.About this task

You should access the ASA r2 reference documentation page for details about the REST API. As part of this, you can search for the string *Platform Specifics* to find details about ASA r2 system support for the API calls and properties.

.Before you begin

You must have the following:

* IP address or host name of the ASA r2 systemâ€™s cluster management LIF
* User name and password for an account with authority to access the REST API

.Steps

 . Type the URL in your browser and press *Enter*:
 +
`https://<ip_address>/docs/api`
 . Sign in using your administrator account.
+
The ASA r2 API documentation page is displayed with the API calls organized in major resource categories.
. As an example of an individual API call, scroll down to the *SAN* category and click *GET /storage/storage-units*.
