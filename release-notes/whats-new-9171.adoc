| Update
| Description

| link:../install-setup/set-up-data-access.html#migrate-data-from-a-third-party-storage-system[Support for data migration from a third-party storage system]
| SAN data migration using Foreign LUN Import (FLI) is supported for ASA r2 systems.  FLI allows you to migrate data from a LUN on a third-party storage system to an ASA r2 system.

== Data protection
[cols="2,4" options="header"]
|===
| Update
| Description

| link:../secure-data/enable-anti-ransomware-protection.html[Support for Autonomous Ransomware Protection with Artificial Intelligence (ARP/AI)]
| ARP/AI can be enabled on ASA r2 storage units. ARP/AI offers additional data protection by detecting and reporting potential ransomware attacks with no learning period.

|link:../data-protection/snapmirror-active-sync.html[SnapMirror Active Sync support for NVMe protocols]
| SnapMirror Active Sync adds support for VMware workloads with NVMe/TCP and NVMe/FC host access for two-node ONTAP clusters.  VMware workload support for NVMe/TCP is contingent on the resolution of VMware Bug ID: TR1049746

|link:../data-protection/manage-consistency-groups.html[Support for geometry changes to consistency groups in SnapMirror active sync relationships]
| ASA r2 systems support geometry changes to consistency groups in a SnapMirror active sync relationship without removing the SnapMirror active sync relationship.  When geometry a change occurs on the primary consistency group, the change is replicated to the secondary consistency group.

|link:../data-protection/snapshot-replication.html[Support for replication of child consistency groups]
| Beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1, you can apply replication policies directly to child consistency groups.

| Update
| Description

| link:../learn-more/hardware-comparison.html[Support for automatic workload balancing]
| Workloads are automatically balanced between the nodes of an HA pair to optimize performance and resource utilization.
