Learn about the new capabilities available in ONTAP 9.16.1 for ASA r2 systems.

== Data protection

// header row
| Update
| Description

| link:../data-protection/manage-consistency-groups.html[Support for hierarchical consistency groups]
| Hierarchical consistency groups allow you to create a parent consistency group that contains multiple child consistency groups. This simplifies data protection and management for complex data structures.

== Protocol support

// header row
| Update
| Description

| link:../get-started/learn-about.html[NVMe support for symmetric Active/Active multipathing] 
| NVMe/FC and NVMe/TCP now support symmetric active-active architecture for multipathing so that all paths between the hosts and storage are active/optimized.

== Storage efficiency

[cols="2,4" options="header"]
|===
// header row
| Update
| Description

| Support for automatic rebalancing of storage units
| ONTAP will automatically rebalance storage units across your storage availability zones for optimal performance and capacity utilization.

| NVMe space deallocation enabled by default
a| Space deallocation (also called “hole punching” and “unmap”) is enabled for NVMe namespaces by default. Space deallocation allows a host to deallocate unused blocks from namespaces to reclaim space. 

This greatly improves overall storage efficiency, especially with file systems that have data high turnover.
