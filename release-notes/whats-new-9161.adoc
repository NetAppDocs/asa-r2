// header row
| Update
| Description

| link:../secure-data/migrate-encryption-keys-between-key-managers.html[Support for encryption key migration between key managers] 
|
When you switch from the ONTAP onboard key manager to an external key manager at the cluster level, you can use the ONTAP command line interface (CLI) to easily migrate the encryption keys from one key manager to the other.

| link:../data-protection/manage-consistency-groups.html[Support for hierarchical consistency groups]
| Hierarchical consistency groups allow you to create a parent consistency group that contains multiple child consistency groups. This simplifies data protection and management for complex data structures.

// header row
| Update
| Description

| link:../get-started/learn-about.html[NVMe support for symmetric Active/Active multipathing] 
| NVMe/FC and NVMe/TCP now support symmetric active-active architecture for multipathing so that all paths between the hosts and storage are active/optimized.

== Storage efficiency

[cols="2,4" options="header"]
|===
// header row
| Update
| Description

| Support for automatic rebalancing of storage units
| ONTAP will automatically rebalance storage units across your storage availability zones for optimal performance and capacity utilization.

| NVMe space deallocation enabled by default
a| Space deallocation (also called “hole punching” and “unmap”) is enabled for NVMe namespaces by default. Space deallocation allows a host to deallocate unused blocks from namespaces to reclaim space. 

This greatly improves overall storage efficiency, especially with file systems that have data high turnover.
