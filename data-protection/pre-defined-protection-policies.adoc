The replication policy defines when updates performed on the ASA r2 cluster are replicated to the remote site.  ONTAP includes various pre-defined data protection policies that you can use for your replication relationships.  

If the pre-defined policies do not meet your needs, you can link:snapshot-replication.html#step-2-optionally-create-a-custom-replication-policy[create a custom replication policy].
