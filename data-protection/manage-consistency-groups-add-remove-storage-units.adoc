Increase or decrease the size of a consistency group by modifying the number of storage units in the consistency group. 

== Add storage units to a consistency group

Expand the amount of storage managed by a consistency group by adding storage units to the consistency group.

You can add existing storage units to your consistency group or you can create new storage units to add to the consistency group.

.Add existing storage units
--
.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the consistency group you want to expand.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Expand*.
. Select *Using existing storage units*.
. Select the storage units to add to the consistency group; then select *Expand*.

.Add new storage units
--
.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the consistency group you want to expand.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Expand*.
. Select *Using new storage units*.
. Enter the number of units you want to create and the capacity per unit.
+
If you create more that one unit, each unit is created with the same capacity and the same host operating system.  To assign a different capacity to each unit, select *Add a different capacity* to assign a different capacity to each unit.
. Select *Expand*.

.Whatâ€™s next

After you create a new storage unit, you should link:../manage-data/provision-san-storage.html#add-host-initiators[add host initiators] and link:../manage-data/provision-san-storage.html#map-the-storage-unit-to-a-host[map the newly created storage unit to a host].  Adding host initiators makes hosts eligible to access the storage units and perform data operations.  Mapping a storage unit to a hosts allows the storage unit to begin serving data to the host it is mapped to.

.What's next?
Existing snapshots of the consistency group won't include your newly added storage units.  You should link:create-snapshots.html#step-2-create-a-snapshot[create an immediate snapshot] of your consistency group to protect your newly added storage units until the next scheduled snapshot is automatically created.

== Remove a storage unit from a consistency group

You should remove a storage unit from a consistency group if you want to delete the storage unit, if you want manage it as part of a different consistency group, or if you no longer need to protect the data it contains. Removing a storage unit from a consistency group breaks the relationship between the storage unit and the consistency group, but does not delete the storage unit.  

.Before you begin
If you are running ONTAP 9.16.1 and the consistency group you from which you want to remove a storage unit is in an SnapMirror active sync relationship, you must link:snapmirror-active-sync-delete-relationship.html[delete the SnapMirror active sync relationship] before you can remove the storage unit. Deleting this relationship before removing storage units from a consistency group is not required in ONTAP 9.17.1 and later releases.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Double-click the consistency group from which you want to remove a storage unit.
. In the *Overview* section, under *Storage units*, select the storage unit you want to remove; then select *Remove from consistency group*.

.Result
The storage unit is no longer a member of the consistency group.

.What's next
If you need to continue data protection for the storage unit, add the storage unit to another consistency group.
