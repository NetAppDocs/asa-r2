To protect data on the ASA r2, you need to create a consistency group containing the storage units that you want to protect.  You cannot protect data that is not in a consistency group.

== Step 1: Create a consistency group

A consistency group is a collection of storage units that are managed as a single unit. Use consistency groups to simplify storage management and data protection for application workloads spanning multiple storage units. 

For example, suppose you have a database spanning 20 storage units.  If you add all 20 storage units to a single consistency group, you can manage them as a solitary dataset instead of as individual units. 

.Steps

Create a consistency group using new storage units or create a consistency group using existing storage units.

====

.Use new storage units
--
. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters]; then select *Using new storage units*.
. Enter a name for the new storage unit, the number of units, and the capacity per unit.
+
If you create more than one storage unit, each unit is created with identical capacity and parameters.  
. Select the host operating system, format, and host mapping.
. If you want to change the default Quality of Service (QoS) policy or create a new QoS policy, select *More Options*.

. Select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters]; then select *Using existing storage units*.
. Enter a name for the consistency group; then search for and select the storage units you want to include in the consistency group.
. Select *Add*.

== Step 2: Create a snapshot

A snapshot is a local, read-only, point-in-time copy of your data that you can use for data restoration.  

You can create a snapshot of a single storage unit, or you can create a snapshot of a consistency group containing multiple storage units.  Storage units must be members of a consistency group to be protected with snapshots. If you create a snapshot of a single storage unit, the other storage units in the consistency group are not protected.   If you create a snapshot of a consistency group, all the storage units in the consistency group are protected.

.Steps

. Create a snapshot of a consistency group or a storage unit.

.. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
.. Hoover over the name of the consistency group you want to protect.
.. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] ; then select *Protect*.

.. In System Manager, select *Storage*.
.. Hoover over the name of the storage unit you want to protect.
.. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] ; then select *Protect*.

// table end
|===

. If you want to create an immediate snapshot, under *Local protection*, select *Add a snapshot now*.
+
Local protection creates the snapshot on the same cluster containing the storage unit. 
+
.. Enter a name for the snapshot or accept the default name; then optionally, enter a SnapMirror label.
. Select *Schedule snapshots*, to select a snapshot policy to govern the creation of your snapshots.
.. Select a snapshot policy.
+
Accept the default snapshot policy, select an existing policy, or create a new policy.

| Select an existing snapshot policy
a| Select image:icon_dropdown_arrow.gif[downward pointing blue arrow] next to the default policy; then select the existing policy that you want to use.

| Create a new snapshot policy
a|
.. Select image:icon_add.png[blue plus sign followed by the word add] ; then enter the snapshot policy parameters.
.. Select *Add policy*.

// table end
|===

. If you want to replicate your snapshots to a remote cluster, under *Remote protection*, select *Replicate to a remote cluster*.
.. Select the source cluster and storage VM; then select the replication policy. 
+
The initial data transfer for replication starts immediately by default.  
. Select *Save*.
