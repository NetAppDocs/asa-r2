To protect data on the ASA r2, you need to create a consistency group containing the storage units that you want to protect; then you need to create a snapshot. Storage units must be members of a consistency group to be protected by snapshots.

== Step 1: Create a consistency group

A consistency group is a collection of storage units that are managed as a single unit. Use consistency groups to simplify storage management and data protection for application workloads spanning multiple storage units. 

.Steps

Create a consistency group using new storage units or create a consistency group using existing storage units.

====

.Use new storage units
--
. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters]; then select *Using new storage units*.
. Enter a name for the new storage unit, the number of units, and the capacity per unit.
+
If you create more than one storage unit, each unit is created with identical capacity and parameters.  
. Select the host operating system, format, and host mapping.
. If you want to change the default Quality of Service (QoS) policy or create a new QoS policy, select *More Options*.

.. Select *Define new policy*.
.. Enter the policy parameters, then select *Add*.

// table end

. Select *Add*.

.What's next

You have created a consistency group containing the storage units you want to protect.  You are now ready to create a snapshot.
--

.Use existing storage units
--
. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters]; then select *Using existing storage units*.
. Enter a name for the consistency group; then search for and select the storage units you want to include in the consistency group.
. Select *Add*.

.What's next

You have created a consistency group containing the storage units you want to protect.  You are now ready to create a snapshot.

== Step 2: Create a snapshot

A snapshot is a local, read-only copy of your data that you can use to restore storage units to specific points in time.  

Snapshots can be created on demand and can be created automatically in regular intervals based on a link:https://review.docs.netapp.com/us-en/asa-r2_asa-r2-9160/data-protection/policies-schedules.html[snapshot policy and schedule]. The snapshot policy and schedule specifies when to create the snapshots, how many copies to retain, how to name them, and how to label them for replication. For example, a system might create one snapshot every day at 12:10 a.m., retain the two most recent copies, name them “daily” (appended with a timestamp), and label them “daily” for replication.

You can create a snapshot of a single storage unit, or you can create a snapshot of a consistency group containing multiple storage units.  Storage units must be members of a consistency group to be protected with snapshots. If you create a snapshot of a single storage unit, the other storage units in the consistency group are not protected.   If you create a snapshot of a consistency group, all the storage units in the consistency group are protected.

.Steps

. Create a snapshot of a consistency group or a storage unit.

| Create a snapshot of a consistency group

.. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
.. Hoover over the name of the consistency group you want to protect.
.. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] ; then select *Protect*.

.. In System Manager, select *Storage*.
.. Hoover over the name of the storage unit you want to protect.
.. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] ; then select *Protect*.

// table end
|===

. If you want to create an immediate snapshot, under *Local protection*, select *Add a snapshot now*.
+
Local protection creates the snapshot on the same cluster containing the storage unit. 
+
.. Enter a name for the snapshot or accept the default name; then optionally, enter a SnapMirror label.
. Select *Schedule snapshots*, to select a snapshot policy to govern the creation of your snapshots.
.. Select a snapshot policy.
+
Accept the default snapshot policy, select an existing policy, or create a new policy.

| Select an existing snapshot policy
a| Select image:icon_dropdown_arrow.gif[downward pointing blue arrow] next to the default policy; then select the existing policy that you want to use.

| Create a new snapshot policy
a|
.. Select image:icon_add.gif[blue plus sign followed by the word add] ; then enter the snapshot policy parameters.
.. Select *Add policy*.

// table end
|===

. If you want to replicate your snapshots to a remote cluster, under *Remote protection*, select *Replicate to a remote cluster*.
.. Select the source cluster and storage VM; then select the replication policy. 
+
The initial data transfer for replication starts immediately by default.  
. Select *Save*.

.What's next?

Now that your data is protect with snapshots, you should link:../secure-data/encrypt-data-at-rest.html[set up snapshot replication] to copy your consistency groups to a geographically remote location for backup and disaster recovery.
