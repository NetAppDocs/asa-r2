[.lead]
Create snapshots of the consistency groups in your ASA r2 storage system to protect the data in the storage units that are part of the consistency group.  If you no longer need to protect the data in any of the storage units in the consistency group, you can remove snapshot protection from the consistency group.

If you no longer need to protect the data from specific storage units in the consistency group, you can remove those storage units from the consistency group.  

== Add snapshot data protection to a consistency group

When you add snapshot data protection to a consistency group, local snapshots of the consistency group are taken at regular intervals based on a pre-defined schedule. 

You can use snapshots to link:restore-data.html[restore data] that is lost or corrupted.  

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the consistency group you want to protect.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Edit*.
. Under *Local protection*, select *Schedule snapshots*.
. Select a snapshot policy.
+
Accept the default snapshot policy, select an existing policy, or create a new policy.
