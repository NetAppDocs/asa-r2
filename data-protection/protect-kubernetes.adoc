[.lead]
Use Trident protect to protect your Kubernetes applications.  Trident protect allows you to migrate applications and data from one Kubernetes cluster to another, replicate applications to a remote system using NetApp SnapMirror technology, and clone applications from staging to production.

[NOTE]
SnapMirror (asynchronous and synchronous) is supported from ASA r2 systems to ASA r2 systems only. SnapMirror is not supported from ASA r2 systems to AFF or FAS systems.
