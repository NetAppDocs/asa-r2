On ASA r2 systems, SnapMirror active sync supports symmetric active/active configurations.	In a symmetric active/active configuration both sites can access local storage for active I/O. If the source cluster fails or is isolated, the mediator triggers an automatic unplanned failover (AUFO) and serves all I/O from the destination cluster until the source cluster recovers.

If you experience an AUFO of your SnapMirror active sync relationship, you should reestablish the relationship and resume operations on the original source cluster after it comes back online.

.Before you begin

* The SnapMirror active sync relationship must be in sync.
* You cannot initiate a planned failover when a nondisruptive operation, such as a storage unit move, is in process. 
* The ONTAP Mediator must be configured, connected, and in quorum.
* To recover lost I/O paths or update I/O path states on your hosts, you need to perform a storage/adapter rescan on the hosts after the primary storage cluster resumes operation.

.Steps

. Select *Protection > Replication*.
. Select the SnapMirror active sync relationship you need to reestablish.
. Wait for the relationship status to display *InSync*.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Failover* to resume operations on the original primary cluster.
