[.lead]
An automatic unplanned failover (AUFO) operation occurs when the primary cluster is down or isolated. The mediator detects when a failover occurs and executes an automatic unplanned failover to the secondary cluster. The secondary cluster is converted to the primary and begins serving clients. 

.Before you begin

* The SnapMirror active sync relationship must be in sync.
* You cannot initiate a planned failover when a nondisruptive operation, such as a storage unit move, is in process. 
* The ONTAP Mediator must be configured, connected, and in quorum.

.Steps

. Select *Protection > Replication*.
. Select the SnapMirror active sync relationship you need to reestablish.
. Wait for the relationship status to display *InSync*.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Failover* to resume operations on the original primary cluster.

.Whatâ€™s next

To prevent loss of I/O paths to your hosts, you need to rescan the host paths after resuming operations on the primary cluster.
