= Manage hierarchical consistency groups on your ASA r2 system
:icons: font

[.lead]
Beginning in ONTAP 9.16.1, you can use System Manager to create hierarchical consistency groups on your ASA r2 system.  In an hierarchical structure, one or more consistency groups are configured as children under a parent consistency group.   

Hierarchical consistency groups allow you to apply individual snapshot policies to each child consistency group and to replicate the snapshots of all the  child consistency groups to a remote cluster as a single unit by replicating the parent.  This simplifies data protection and management for complex data structures.  For example, suppose you create a parent consistency group called `SVM1_app` which contains two child consistency groups: `SVM1app_data` for application data and `SVM1app_logs` for application logs.  Snapshots of `SVM1app_data` are taken every 15 minutes and snapshots of `SVM1app_logs` are taken every hour.  The parent consistency group, `SVM1_app,` has a SnapMirror policy that replicates the snapshots of both `SVM1app_data` and `SVM1app_logs` to a remote cluster every 24 hours.  The parent consistency group `SVM1_app` is managed as a single unit and the child consistency groups are managed as separate units.

== Promote an existing consistency group into a parent consistency group

Storage units cannot be directly associated with a parent consistency group.  If you convert an existing consistency group to a parent, a new child consistency group is created and the storage units belonging to the converted consistency group are moved to the new child consistency group.  

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the consistency group you want convert into a parent consistency group.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Promote to parent consistency group*.
. Enter a name for the new child consistency group or accept the default name; then select the consistency group component type.
. Select *Promote*.

.What's next?
You can create additional child consistency groups under the parent consistency group.  You can also link:../secure-data/encrypt-data-at-rest.html[set up snapshot replication] to copy the parent consistency group to a geographically remote location for backup and disaster recovery.

== Demote a parent consistency group to a single consistency group

When you _demote_ a parent consistency group to a single consistency group, the storage units of the associated child consistency groups are added to the parent consistency group.  The child consistency groups are deleted and the parent is then managed as a single consistency group.

.Steps 

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the parent consistency group you want to demote.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Demote to a single consistency group*.
. Select *Demote*

.What's next?

link:policies-schedules.html#apply-a-snapshot-policy-to-a-consistency-group[Add a snapshot policy] to the demoted consistency group to protect the storage units that were previously managed by the child consistency groups.

== Create a child consistency group

Creating child consistency groups allows you to apply individual snapshot policies to each child while applying a replication policy to all the child consistency groups at the parent level. 

You can create a child consistency group from a new or existing consistency group.

.From a new consistency group

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the parent consistency group you want to add a child consistency group to.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Add a new child consistency group*.
. Enter a name for the child consistency group or accept the default name; then select the consistency group component type.    
. Select to add existing storage units to the child consistency group or to create new storage units.
+
If you create new storage units, enter the number of units you want to create and the capacity per unit; then enter the host information.
+
If you create more than one storage unit, each unit is created with the same capacity and the same host operating system. To assign a different capacity to each unit, select *Add a different capacity*.
. Select *Add*.

.From an existing consistency group
--
.Before you begin
If the consistency group you would like to use is already the child of another consistency group, you must detach it from the existing parent consistency group before you can move it to a new parent consistency group.

.Steps
. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Select the existing consistency group that you would like to make a child consistency group.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Move under different consistency group*.

. Enter a new name for the child consistency group or accept the default name; then select the consistency group component type.
. Select the existing consistency group that you would like to make the parent consistency group or select to create a new parent consistency group.
+
If you select to create a new parent consistency group, enter a name for the parent consistency group or accept the default name; then select the consistency application component type.
. Select *Move*.

After you create a child consistency group, you can link:policies-schedules.html#apply-a-snapshot-policy-to-a-consistency-group[apply individual snapshot protection policies] to each child consistency group. You can also link:snapshot-replication.html[set up a replication policy] on the parent consistency group to replicate the snapshots of all the child consistency groups to a remote cluster as a single unit.

== Detach a child consistency group from a parent consistency group

When you detach a child consistency group from a parent consistency group, the child consistency group is removed from the parent consistency group and is managed as a single consistency group. The replication policy applied to the parent are no longer applied to the detached child consistency group.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Select the parent consistency group.
. Select over the child consistency group you want to detach.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Detach from parent*.
. Enter a new name for the consistency group you are detaching or accept the default name; then select the consistency group application type.
. Select *Detach*.

== Delete a consistency group

If you no longer need to manage the members of a consistency group as a single unit, you can delete the consistency group.  After a consistency group is deleted, the storage units previously in the group remain active on the cluster. If the consistency group was in a replication relationship, the replicated copies remain on the remote cluster.

.Before you begin
If you are running ONTAP 9.16.1, and the consistency group you want to delete is in a replication relationship, you must break the relationship before you delete the consistency group. 


.Steps
. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the consistency group you want to delete.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Delete*.
. Accept the warning, then select *Delete*.

.What's next?

After you delete a consistency group, the storage units previously in the consistency group are no longer protected by snapshots.  Consider adding these storage units to another consistency group to protect them against data loss.
