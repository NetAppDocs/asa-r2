[.lead]
If you no longer need to manage the members of a consistency group as a single unit, you can delete the consistency group.  After a consistency group is deleted, the storage units previously in the group remain active on the cluster. If the consistency group was in a replication relationship, the replicated copies remain on the remote cluster.

.Before you begin
If you are running ONTAP 9.16.1, and the consistency group you want to delete is in a SnapMirror active sync relationship, you must link:snapmirror-active-sync-break-relationship.html[break the SnapMirror active sync relationship] before you delete the consistency group. 

.Steps
. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the consistency group you want to delete.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Delete*.
. Accept the warning, then select *Delete*.

.What's next?
After you delete a consistency group, the storage units previously in the consistency group are no longer protected by snapshots.  Consider adding these storage units to another consistency group to protect them against data loss.
