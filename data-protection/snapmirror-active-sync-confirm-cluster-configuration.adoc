SnapMirror active sync uses peered clusters to protect your data in the event of a failover. Before you configure SnapMirror active sync, you should confirm that your ASA r2 clusters are in the proper peering relationships and meet other configuration requirements.

.Steps

. Confirm that a cluster peering relationship exists between the clusters.
+
[NOTE]
The default IPspace is required by SnapMirror active sync for cluster peer relationships.  A custom IPspace isnâ€™t supported.

. Confirm that at least one LIF is created on each node in the cluster.
