If you no longer require near zero RPO and RTO for your business-critical applications, you can remove the SnapMirror active sync configuration from your ASA r2 system.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Replication*.
. Select *Local destinations*.
. Next to the SnapMirror active sync relationship you want to remove, select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Delete*.
. Select *Release the source consistency group base snapshots*.
. Select *Delete*.

.Result
The SnapMirror active sync relationship is removed and the source consistency group base snapshots are released.  The storage units in the consistency group are no longer protected by SnapMirror active sync.
