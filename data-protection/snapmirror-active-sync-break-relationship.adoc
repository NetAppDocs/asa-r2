[.lead]
In certain situations, you might need to break a SnapMirror active sync relationship.  For example, if are running ONTAP 9.16.1 and you want to modify the size of a consistency group that is in a SnapMirror active sync relationship, you must break the relationship before you can modify the consistency group's size.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Replication*.
. Select *Local destinations*.
. Next to the SnapMirror active sync relationship that you want to break, select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Break*.
. Select *Break*.

.Result
The SnapMirror active sync relationship between the primary and secondary consistency group is broken.
