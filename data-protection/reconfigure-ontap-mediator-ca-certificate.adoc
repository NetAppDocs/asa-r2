If you configure ONTAP Mediator or ONTAP Cloud Mediator with a self-signed certificate, you can reconfigure the mediator to use a third-party certificate.  Third party certificates might be preferred or required by your organization for security reasons.  

== Step 1: Remove the mediator configuration

To reconfigure the mediator, you must first remove its current configuration from the cluster.

.Steps 

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Overview*.
. In the right pane, under *Mediators*, select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] next to the cluster peer with the mediator configuration that you want to remove; then select *Remove*.
+
If you have multiple mediators installed, and you want to remove all configurations, select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] next to *Mediators*; then select *Remove*.
. Select *Remove* to confirm that you want to remove the mediator configuration.

== Step 2:  Remove the self-signed certificate

After the mediator configuration is removed, you should remove the associated self-signed certificate from the cluster.

.Steps

. Select *Cluster > Settings*.
. Under *Security*, select *Certificates*.
. Select the certificate that you want to remove.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Delete*.

== Step 3: Reinstall the mediator with a third-party certificate

After you have removed the associated self-signed certificate, you can reconfigure the mediator with the third-party certificate.

.Steps

. Select *Protection > Overview*.
. In the right pane, under *Mediators*, select *Add a mediator*.
. Select the *Mediator type*.
. For a *Cloud* mediator enter the organization ID, client ID and client secret.  For an *On-premises* mediator enter the IP address, port, mediator user name, and mediator password.
. Select a cluster peer from the list of eligible cluster peers or select *Add a cluster peer* to add a new one.
. Under *Certificate*, enter the third-party certificate information.
. Select *Add*.

.Result

The ONTAP Mediator or ONTAP Cloud Mediator is reconfigured to use the third-party certificate.  You can now use the mediator to manage SnapMirror active sync relationships.
