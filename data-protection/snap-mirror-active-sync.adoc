Use SnapMirror active sync, to protect host applications that require a zero recovery point objective (RPO) and a zero recovery time objective (RTO) from outages due to an unexpected disruption or site disaster.

SnapMirror active sync offers continuous availability for business-critical applications by creating a copy of your data at a secondary site and enabling your host applications to automatically and transparently failover in the event of a disaster. 

On ASA r2 systems, SnapMirror active sync supports symmetric active/active and asymmetric active/active configurations.	In an asymmetric configuration, data on the secondary site is proxied to a storage unit. In a symmetric active/active configuration, both sites can access local storage for active I/O.
