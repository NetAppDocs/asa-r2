[.lead]
You must configure ONTAP Mediator or ONTAP Cloud Mediator before you can begin using SnapMirror active sync for cluster monitoring.  ONTAP Mediator and ONTAP Cloud Mediator both provide a persistent and fenced store for high availability (HA) metadata used by the ONTAP clusters in a SnapMirror active sync relationship. Additionally, both mediators provide a synchronous node health query functionality to aid in quorum determination and serves as a ping proxy for controller liveliness detection.

.Before you begin

* If you are using ONTAP Cloud Mediator, verify that your ASA r2 system meets the necessary link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-metrocluster/install-ip/concept_mediator_requirements.html[prerequisites^].

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Overview*.
. In the right pane, under *Mediators* select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Remove mediator*.
. Select *Cluster > Settings*.
. Under *Security*, select *Certificates*.
. Select the certificate that you want to remove.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Delete*.
. Select *Protection > Overview*.
. In the right pane under *Mediators*, select *Add a mediator*.
. Select the *Mediator type*.
. For a *Cloud* mediator enter the organization ID, client ID and client secret.  For an *On-premises* mediator enter the IP address, port, mediator user name and mediator password.
. Select the cluster peer from the list of eligible cluster peers or select *Add a cluster peer* to add a new one.
. Enter the third-party certificate information.
. Select *Add*.

.What's next?
After you have initialized the mediator, you can link:configure-snapmirror-active-sync.html[configure SnapMirror active sync] to create a copy of your data at a secondary site and enable your host applications to automatically and transparently failover in the event of a disaster.
