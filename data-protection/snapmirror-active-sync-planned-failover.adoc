SnapMirror active sync offers continuous availability for business-critical applications by creating a copy of your data at a secondary site and enabling your host applications to automatically and transparently fail over in the event of a disaster. You might need to perform a planned failover of your SnapMirror active sync relationship to test the failover process or to perform maintenance on the primary site.

.Before you begin

* The SnapMirror active sync relationship must be in sync.
* You cannot initiate a planned failover when a nondisruptive operation, such as a storage unit move, is in process. 
* ONTAP Mediator or ONTAP Cloud Mediator must be configured, connected, and in quorum.

.Steps

. Select *Protection > Replication*.
. Select the SnapMirror active sync relationship you want to fail over.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Failover*.

.Whatâ€™s next

Use the `snapmirror failover show` command in the ONTAP command line interface (CLI) to monitor the status of the failover.
