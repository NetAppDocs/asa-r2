= Perform a planned failover of ASA r2 clusters in a SnapMirror active sync relationship
:icons: font

[.lead]
SnapMirror active sync offers continuous availability for business-critical applications by creating a copy of your data at a secondary site and enabling your host applications to automatically and transparently failover in the event of a disaster. 

On ASA r2 systems, SnapMirror active sync supports symmetric active/active. In a symmetric active/active configuration, both sites can access local storage for active I/O.

.Before you begin

* The SnapMirror active sync relationship must be in sync.
* You cannot initiate a planned failover when a nondisruptive operation, such as a storage unit move, is in process. 
* The ONTAP Mediator must be configured, connected, and in quorum.

.Steps

. Select *Protection>Replication*.
. Select the SnapMirror active sync relationship you want to failover.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Failover*.

.Whatâ€™s next

Use the `snapmirror failover show`` command in the ONTAP command line interface (CLI) to monitor the status of the failover.
