[.lead]
A consistency group is a collection of storage units that are managed as a single unit. Use consistency groups for simplified storage management. For example, suppose you have a database consisting of 10 storage units in a consistency group, and you need to back up the entire database.  Instead of backing up each storage unit, you can back up the entire database by simply adding snapshot data protection to the consistency group. Backing up the storage units as a consistency group instead of individually also provides a consistent backup of all the units, while backing up units individually could potentially create inconsistencies.

== Add snapshot data protection to a consistency group

When you add snapshot data protection to a consistency group, local snapshots of the consistency group are taken at regular intervals based on a pre-defined schedule. 

You can use snapshots to link:restore-data.html[restore data] that is lost or corrupted.  

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the consistency group you want to protect.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Edit*.
. Under *Local protection*, select *Schedule snapshots*.
. Select a snapshot policy.
+
Accept the default snapshot policy, select an existing policy, or create a new policy.

.. Select the policy schedule.
.. Under *Maximum snapshots*, enter the maximum number of snapshots that you want to retain of the consistency group.
.. Optionally, under *SnapMirror label* enter a SnapMirror label.
.. Select *Save*.

// table end

. Select *Edit*.

.What's next
Now that your data is protect with snapshots, you should link:../secure-data/encrypt-data-at-rest.html[set up snapshot replication] to copy your consistency groups to a geographically remote location for backup and disaster recovery.


== Remove snapshot data protection from a consistency group

When you remove snapshot data protection from a consistency group, snapshots are disabled for all the storage units in the consistency group. 

.Steps
. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the consistency group you want to stop protecting.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Edit*.
. Under *Local protection*, deselect Schedule snapshots.
. Select *Edit*.

== Expand a consistency group

Expand the amount of storage managed by a consistency group by adding storage units to the consistency group.

You can add existing storage units to your consistency group or you can create new storage units to add to the consistency group.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the consistency group you want to expand.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Expand*.
. Select *Using existing storage units*.

. Select *Using new storage units*.
. Enter the number of units you want to create and the capacity per unit.

If you create more that one unit, each unit is created with the same capacity and the same host operating system.  To assign a different capacity to each unit, select *Add a different capacity* to assign a different capacity to each unit.
. Select *Expand*.

.Whatâ€™s next

After you create a new storage unit, you should link:../manage-data/provision-san-storage.html#add-host-initiators[add host initiators] and link:../manage-data/provision-san-storage.html#map-the-storage-unit-to-a-host[map the newly created storage unit to a host].  Adding host initiators makes hosts eligible to access the storage units and perform data operations.  Mapping a storage unit to a hosts allows the storage unit to begin serving data to the host it is mapped to.

// end tabbed area

.What's next?
Existing snapshots of the consistency group won't include your newly added storage units.  You should link:create-snapshots.html#step-2-create-a-snapshot[create an immediate snapshot] of your consistency group to protect your newly added storage units until the next scheduled snapshot is automatically created.

== Remove a storage unit from a consistency group
Removing a storage unit from a consistency group breaks the relationship between the storage unit and the consistency group, but does not delete the storage unit.  You should remove a storage unit from a consistency group, only if you want to manage it as part of a different consistency group or if you no longer need to protect the data it contains.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Double-click the consistency group from which you want to remove a storage unit.
. In the *Overview* section, under *Storage units*, select the storage unit you want to remove; then select *Remove from consistency group*.

== Delete a consistency group

If you no longer need to manage the members of a consistency group as a single unit, you can delete the consistency group.  After a consistency group is deleted, the storage units previously in the group remain active on the cluster.

.Before you begin
If the consistency group you want to delete is in a replication relationship, you must break the relationship before you delete the consistency group. After you delete a previously replication consistency group, the storage units that were in the consistency group remain active on the cluster and their replicated copies remain on the remote cluster.

.Steps
. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the consistency group you want to delete.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Delete*.
. Accept the warning, then select *Delete*.

.What's next?

After you delete a consistency group, the storage units previously in the consistency group are no longer protected by snapshots.  Consider adding these storage units to another consistency group to protect them against data loss.
