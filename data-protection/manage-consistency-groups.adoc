= Manage ONTAP consistency groups on ASA r2 storage systems
:icons: font

[.lead]
A consistency group is a collection of storage units that are managed as a single unit. Use consistency groups for simplified storage management. For example, suppose you have a database consisting of 10 storage units in a consistency group, and you need to back up the entire database.  Instead of backing up each storage unit, you can back up the entire database by simply adding snapshot data protection to the consistency group. Backing up the storage units as a consistency group instead of individually also provides a consistent backup of all the units, while backing up units individually could potentially create inconsistencies.

Beginning in ONTAP 9.16.1, you can use System Manager to create hierarchical consistency groups on your ASA r2 system.  In an hierarchial structure, one or more consistency groups are contained as children inside of a parent consistency group.  Storage units are not assigned directly to the parent.  Storage units are assigned to the child consistency groups just as they are assigned to consistency groups not in a hierarchial structure.  

Hierarchical consistency groups allow you to apply individual snapshot policies to each child consistency group and replicate the snapshots of all the  child consistency groups belong to a parent to a remote cluster as a single unit by replicating the parent.  For example, suppose you create a parent consistency group called `SVM1_app` which contains two child consistency groups: `SVM1app_data` for application data and `SVM1app_logs` for application logs.  Snapshots of `SVM1app_data` are taken every 15 minutes and snapshots of `SVM1app_logs` are taken every hour.  The parent consistency group `SVM1_app` has a SnapMirror policy that replicates the snapshots of both `SVM1app_data` and `SVM1app_logs` to a remote cluster every 24 hours.  The parent consistency group `SVM1_app` is managed as a single unit and the child consistency groups are managed as separate units.

== Add snapshot data protection to a consistency group

When you add snapshot data protection to a consistency group, local snapshots of the consistency group are taken at regular intervals based on a pre-defined schedule. 

You can use snapshots to link:restore-data.html[restore data] that is lost or corrupted.  

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the consistency group you want to protect.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Edit*.
. Under *Local protection*, select *Schedule snapshots*.
. Select a snapshot policy.
+
Accept the default snapshot policy, select an existing policy, or create a new policy.

. Select *Edit*.

.What's next
Now that your data is protected with snapshots, you should link:../secure-data/encrypt-data-at-rest.html[set up snapshot replication] to copy your consistency groups to a geographically remote location for backup and disaster recovery.


== Remove snapshot data protection from a consistency group

When you remove snapshot data protection from a consistency group, snapshots are disabled for all the storage units in the consistency group. 

.Steps
. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the consistency group you want to stop protecting.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Edit*.
. Under *Local protection*, deselect Schedule snapshots.
. Select *Edit*.

.Result

Snapshots will not be taken for any of the storage units in the consistency group.

== Add storage units to a consistency group

Expand the amount of storage managed by a consistency group by adding storage units to the consistency group.

You can add existing storage units to your consistency group or you can create new storage units to add to the consistency group.

If you create more that one unit, each unit is created with the same capacity and the same host operating system.  To assign a different capacity to each unit, select *Add a different capacity* to assign a different capacity to each unit.
. Select *Expand*.

.Whatâ€™s next

After you create a new storage unit, you should link:../manage-data/provision-san-storage.html#add-host-initiators[add host initiators] and link:../manage-data/provision-san-storage.html#map-the-storage-unit-to-a-host[map the newly created storage unit to a host].  Adding host initiators makes hosts eligible to access the storage units and perform data operations.  Mapping a storage unit to a hosts allows the storage unit to begin serving data to the host it is mapped to.
--

// end tabbed area

.What's next?
Existing snapshots of the consistency group won't include your newly added storage units.  You should link:create-snapshots.html#step-2-create-a-snapshot[create an immediate snapshot] of your consistency group to protect your newly added storage units until the next scheduled snapshot is automatically created.

== Remove a storage unit from a consistency group
You should remove a storage unit from a consistency group if you want to delete the storage unit, if you want manage it as part of a different consistency group, or if you no longer need to protect the data it contains. Removing a storage unit from a consistency group breaks the relationship between the storage unit and the consistency group, but does not delete the storage unit.  

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Double-click the consistency group from which you want to remove a storage unit.
. In the *Overview* section, under *Storage units*, select the storage unit you want to remove; then select *Remove from consistency group*.

.Result
The storage unit is no longer a member of the consistency group.

.What's next
If you need to continue data protection for the storage unit, add the storage unit to another consistency group.

== Convert an existing consistency group to a parent consistency group

Storage units cannot be directly associated with a parent consistency group.  If you convert an existing consistency group to a parent, a new child consistency group is created and the the storage units belonging to the converted consistency group are moved to the new child consistency group.  

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the consistency group you want convert into a parent consistency group.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Promote to parent consistency group*.
. Enter a name for the parent consistency group or accept the default name; then select the consistency group component type.
. Select *Promote*.

== Create a child consistency group

You can create a new consistency group to use as a child to a parent consistency group or you can make an existing consistency group a child consistency group.  When you create a new consistency group, you can add existing storage units to the child consistency group or create new storage units.

To move a child consistency group to a different parent consistency group, you must first detach the child consistency group from the parent consistency group.

// end tabbed area


== Demote a parent consistency group to a single consistency group

When you _demote_ a parent consistency group to a single consistency group, the storage units of the associated child consistency groups are added to the parent consistency group.  The child consistency groups are deleted and the the parent is then managed as a single consistency group.

.Steps 

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the parent consistency group you want to demote.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Demote to a single consistency group*.
. Select *Demote*

== Detach a child consistency group from a parent consistency group

When you detach a child consistency group from a parent consistency group, the child consistency group is removed from the parent consistency group and is managed as a single consistency group. The snapshot policies applied to the parent are no longer applied to the detached child consistency group.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Select the parent consistency group.
. Select over the child consistency group you want to detach.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Detach from parent*.
. Enter a new name for the consistency group you are detaching or accept the default name; then select the consistency group application type.
. Select *Detach*.



== Delete a consistency group

If you no longer need to manage the members of a consistency group as a single unit, you can delete the consistency group.  After a consistency group is deleted, the storage units previously in the group remain active on the cluster.

.Before you begin
If the consistency group you want to delete is in a replication relationship, you must break the relationship before you delete the consistency group. After you delete a replication consistency group, the storage units that were in the consistency group remain active on the cluster and their replicated copies remain on the remote cluster.


.Steps
. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the consistency group you want to delete.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Delete*.
. Accept the warning, then select *Delete*.

.What's next?

After you delete a consistency group, the storage units previously in the consistency group are no longer protected by snapshots.  Consider adding these storage units to another consistency group to protect them against data loss.
