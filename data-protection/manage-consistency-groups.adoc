Use consistency groups for simplified management of storage units. Consistency groups allow you to perform various actions to multiple storage units at the same time instead of performing the same action individually on each unit. For example, suppose you have a database consisting of 10 storage units in a consistency group, and you need to back up the entire database.  Instead of backing up each storage unit, you can back up the entire database by simply adding snapshot data protection to the consistency group. 

== Add snapshot data protection to a consistency group

Enable local snapshots of a consistency group to provide data protection for all the storage units in the group.  

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hoover over the consistency group you want to protect.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Edit*.
. Under *Local protection*, select *Schedule snapshots*.
. Accept the default Snapshot policy or select a different policy.  
+
Select image:icon_add.png[blue plus sign followed by the word add] to create a new policy.
. Enter the policy parameters; then select *Add policy*.
. Select *Edit*.


== Remove snapshot data protection from a consistency group

Disable local snapshots of a consistency group to remove data protection from all the storage units in the group.  

.Steps
. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hoover over the consistency group you want to stop protecting.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Edit*.
. Under *Local protection*, deselect Schedule snapshots.
. Select *Edit*.

== Increase a consistency group

Increase the amount of storage managed by a consistency group by adding new or existing storage units to the consistency group.

== Remove a storage unit from a consistency group
If you remove a storage unit from a consistency group, all existing snapshots of the storage unit are deleted. You should remove a storage unit from a consistency group, only if you want to manage it as part of a different consistency group or if you no longer need to protect the data it contains.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Double-click the consistency group from which you want to remove a storage unit.
. In the *Overview* section, under *Storage units*, select the storage unit you want to remove; then select *Remove from consistency group*.

== Delete a consistency group

If you no longer need to manage the members of a consistency group as a single unit, you can delete the consistency group.  Deleting the consistency group does not remove or change the properties of storage units in the consistency group. For example, suppose you delete a consistency group containing 10 storage units replicated to a remote destination.  After the consistency group is deleted, the 10 storage units previously in the consistency group are still active on the cluster and are still replicated to the remote cluster. Any new actions to the storage units are applied to each unit individually and do not impact the other previous members of the consistency group.

.Steps
. In System Manager, select *Protection > Consistency groups*.
. Hoover over the consistency group you want to delete.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Delete*.
. Accept the warning, then select *Delete*.
