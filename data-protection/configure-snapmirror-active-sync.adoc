[.lead]
Configure SnapMirror active sync to create a copy of your data at a secondary site and enable your host applications to automatically and transparently failover in the event of a disaster. 

On ASA r2 systems, SnapMirror active sync supports symmetric active/active and asymmetric active/active configurations.	In an asymmetric configuration, data on the secondary site is proxied to a storage unit. In a symmetric active/active configuration, both sites can access local storage for active I/O.

.Before you begin
link:create-snapshots.html#step-1-optionally-create-a-consistency-group[Create a consistency group] on the primary site with new storage units.  If you want to create a non-uniform symmetric active/active configuration, also create a consistency group on the secondary site with new storage units.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Protection>Consistency groups*.
. Hover over the name of the consistency group you want to protect with SnapMirror active sync.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots];then select *Protect*.
. Under *Remote protection*, select *Replicate to a remote cluster*.
. Select the cluster peer or select to *Add a new one*.
. Select the storage VM.
. Select the replication policy.
+
For symmetric active/active protection, select *AutomatedFailOverDuplex* for the replication policy.  For asymmetric protection, select *Asynchronous* for the replication policy.
. If you are creating a non-uniform symmetric active/active configuration, select *Destination settings*; then input the name of the new destination consistency group you create before beginning this procedure.
. Select *Save*.

.Result
SnapMirror active sync is configured to protect your data so that you can continue operations with zero recovery point objective (RPO) and zero recovery time objective (RTO) in the event of a disaster.
