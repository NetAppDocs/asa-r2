[.lead]
Use encryption and tamperproof snapshots to secure your data against malicious attacks such as theft or ransomware. Encryption is available at the hardware and software layers of your storage system and, when using the NVMe/TCP protocol, you can also encrypt data transferred over the network.

== Encrypt data at rest

Encrypt data at rest so that it can’t be read if a storage medium is repurposed, returned, misplaced, or stolen.  Use hardware and software encryption to enable dual-layer protection.

NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE) supports hardware encryption using self-encrypting drives (SEDs).  SEDs encrypt data as it is written. Encrypted data can’t be read without the encryption key stored on the SED. Nodes attempting to read from an SED must be authenticated to access the encryption key.  Nodes are authenticated by obtaining an authentication key from a key manager.  Use the ASA r2 onboard key manager or an external key manager to serve authentication keys to your nodes.

In addition to NSE, you can also enable software encryption to add another layer of security to your data.
