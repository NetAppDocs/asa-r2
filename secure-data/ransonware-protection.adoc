For protection against ransomware attacks, replicate snapshots to a remote cluster, then lock the destination snapshots to make them tamperproof. Locked snapshots cannot be deleted accidentally or maliciously.  You can use locked snapshots to recover data if a storage unit is compromised by a ransomware attack.
