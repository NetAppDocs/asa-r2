If you are using the IP protocol on your ASA r2 system, you can configure IP security (IPsec) to enhance your data security.  IPsec is an internet standard that provides data-in-flight encryption, authentication for the traffic flowing between the network endpoints at an IP level, and protection against replay and malicious man-in-the-middle attacks on your data. 

For ASA r2 systems, IPsec is available for iSCSI and NVMe/TCP hosts.

On certain ASA r2 systems, several of the cryptographic operations, such as encryption and integrity checks, can be offloaded to a supported network interface controller (NIC) card. Using this hardware offload option can significantly improve the performance and throughput of the network traffic protected by IPsec.

The following NIC cards are supported for hardware offload on the following ASA r2 systems:
