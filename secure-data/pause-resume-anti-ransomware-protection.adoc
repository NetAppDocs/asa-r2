[.lead]

Beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1, you can use Autonomous Ransomware Protection with Artificial Intelligence (ARP/AI) to protect the data on your ASA r2 system. If you are planning an unusual workload event, you can temporarily suspend ARP/AI analysis to prevent false positive detections of ransomware attacks. Once your workload is complete, you can resume ARP/AI analysis.

== Pause ARP/AI

Before you begin an unusual workload event, you might need to temporarily suspend the ARP/AI analysis to prevent false positive detections of ransomware attacks.  

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Storage*.
. Select the storage units for which you want to pause ARP/AI.
. Select *Pause anti-ransomware*.

.Result

ARP/AI analysis is paused for the selected storage units, and no suspicious activity is reported to you in System Manager until you resume ARP/AI.

== Resume ARP/AI

If you pause ARP/AI during an unusual workload, once your workload is complete, you should resume it to protect your data against ransomware attacks.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Storage*.
. Select the storage units for which you want to resume ARP/AI.
. Select *Resume anti-ransomware*.

.Result

Analysis of potential ransomware attacks is resumed, and suspicious activity is reported to you in System Manager.
