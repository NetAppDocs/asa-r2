[.lead]
Beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1, you can use Autonomous Ransomware Protection with Artificial Intelligence (ARP/AI) to protect the data on your ASA r2 system. ARP/AI quickly detects potential ransomware threats, automatically creates an ARP snapshot to protect your data, and displays a warning message in System Manager to alert you of suspicious activity.

ARP improves cyber resiliency by adopting a machine-learning model for anti-ransomware analytics that detects constantly evolving forms of ransomware with 98% accuracy for SAN environments. ARP's machine-learning model is pre-trained on a large dataset of files both before and after a simulated ransomware attack. This resource-intensive training is done outside ONTAP, and the pre-trained model that results from this training is included on-box with ONTAP. This model is not accessible or modifiable through the CLI or API.  Consequently, ARP/AI is active immediately after enablement; there is no link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/index.html#learning-and-active-modes[learning period^].

[NOTE]
No ransomware detection or prevention system can completely guarantee safety from a ransomware attack. Although it's possible an attack might go undetected, ARP/AI acts as an important additional layer of defense if anti-virus software fails to detect an intrusion.

.About this task

* ARP/AI support is included with the link:https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/os/ONTAP_9.10.1_and_later_licensing_overview[ONTAP One license].

* Beginning with ONTAP 9.18.1, ARP/AI is enabled by default on all existing and newly created storage units 12 hours after upgrading to ONTAP 9.18.1 or initializing a new ONTAP 9.18.1 ASA r2 cluster.  You need to enable ARP/AI only if you disabled the default enablement.

* After you have enabled ARP/AI, you should link:../administer/update-firmware.html#enable-automatic-updates[enable automatic updates for your security files] to automatically receive new security updates.

== Enable ARP/AI on all storage units in an storage VM
You can enable ARP/AI on all storage units created in a storage virtual machine (VM) by default. This means that any new storage units created in the storage VM will have ARP/AI enabled automatically. You can also apply ARP/AI to existing storage units in the storage VM.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster > Storage VMs*.
. Select the storage VM on which you want to enable ARP/AI.
. In the *Security* section, next to *Anti-ransomware*, select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Edit anti-ransomware settings*.
. Select *Enable anti-ransomware*.
+
This enables ARP/AI on all future storage units created on the selected storage VM by default.
. To apply ARP to existing storage units on the selected storage VM, select *Apply this change to all applicable existing storage units on this storage VM*.
. Select *Save*.

.Result

All new storage units you create on the storage VM are protected against ransomware attacks by default, and suspicious activity is reported to you in System Manager.

== Enable ARP/AI on specific storage units in an storage VM

If you do not want ARP/AI enabled on all the storage units in an storage VM, you can select the specific units you want enabled. 

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Storage*.
. Select the storage units for which you want to enable ARP/AI.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Enable anti-ransomware*.
. Select *Enable*.

.Result
The storage units you selected are protected against ransomware attacks, and suspicious activity is reported to you in System Manager.
