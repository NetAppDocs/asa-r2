[.lead]

Beginning with ONTAP 9.17.1, you can use Autonomous Ransomware Protection with Artificial Intelligence (ARP/AI) to protect the data on your ASA r2 system. ARP/AI quickly detects potential ransomware threats, automatically creates an ARP snapshot to protect your data, and displays a warning message in System Manager to alert you of suspicious activity.

ARP/AI improves cyber resiliency by adopting a machine-learning model for anti-ransomware analytics that detects constantly evolving forms of ransomware with 99% accuracy. The machine-learning model is pre-trained on a large dataset of files both before and after a simulated ransomware attack. This resource-intensive training is done outside ONTAP, but the learning from this training is used for the model inside ONTAP. Consequently, ARP/AI is active immediately after enablement; there is no link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/index.html#learning-and-active-modes[learning period^].

[NOTE]
No ransomware detection or prevention system can completely guarantee safety from a ransomware attack. Although it's possible an attack might go undetected, ARP/AI acts as an important additional layer of defense if anti-virus software fails to detect an intrusion.

.About this task

ARP/AI support is included with the link:https://kb.netapp.com/onprem/ontap/os/ONTAP_9.10.1_and_later_licensing_overview[ONTAP ONE license].

After you have enabled ARP/AI, you should link:../administer/update-firmware.html#enable-automatic-updates[enable automatic updates for your security files] to automatically receive new security updates.

== Enable ARP/AI on all storage units in an SVM
You can enable ARP/AI on all storage units created in a storage virtual machine (SVM) by default. This means that any new storage units created in the SVM will have ARP/AI enabled automatically. You can also apply ARP/AI to existing storage units in the SVM.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster > Storage VMs*.
. Select the storage VM on which you want to enable ARP/AI.
. In the *Security* section, next to *Anti-ransomware*, select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Edit anti-ransomware settings*.
. Select *Enable anti-ransomware*.
+
This enables ARP/AI on all future storage units created on the selected storage VM by default.
. To apply ARP to existing storage units on the selected storage VM, select *Apply this change to all applicable existing storage units on this storage VM*.
. Select *Save*.

.Result

All new storage units you create on the SVM are protected against ransomware attacks by default, and suspicious activity is reported to you in System Manager.

== Enable ARP/AI on a single storage unit

You can enable ARP/AI on a single storage unit to protect it against ransomware attacks. 

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Storage*.
. Next to the storage unit for which you want to enable ARP/AI, select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Enable anti-ransomware*.
. Select *Enable*.

.Result

The single storage unit you selected is protected against ransomware attacks, and suspicious activity is reported to you in System Manager.

== Enable ARP/AI on multiple storage units

You can enable ARP/AI on multiple storage units to protect them against ransomware attacks.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Storage*.
. Select the storage units for which you want to enable ARP/AI.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots]; then select *Enable anti-ransomware*.
. Select *Enable*.

.Result
The multiple storage units you selected are protected against ransomware attacks, and suspicious activity is reported to you in System Manager.
