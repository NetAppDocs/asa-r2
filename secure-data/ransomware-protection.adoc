For protection against ransomware attacks, replicate snapshots to a remote cluster, then lock the destination snapshots to make them tamper-proof. Locked snapshots cannot be deleted accidentally or maliciously.  You can use locked snapshots to recover data if a storage unit is compromised by a ransomware attack.

== Initialize the Snaplock compliance clock

Before you can create tamper-proof snapshots, you must initialize the Snaplock compliance clock on your local and destination cluster.

.Steps

. Select *Cluster > Overview*.
. In the *Nodes* section, select *Initialize SnapLock Compliance Clock*.
. Select *Initialize*.
. Verify that the compliance clock is initialized.
.. Select *Cluster > Overview*.   
.. In the *Nodes* section, select image:icon_show_hide.png[three blue columns on white background]; then select *SnapLock Compliance Clock*.

.What’s next?

After you have initialized the Snaplock compliance clock on your local and destination cluster, you are ready to  link:../data-protection/snapshot-replication.html#step-3-create-a-replication-relationship[create a replication relationship with locked snapshots].
