Encrypt data at rest so that it can’t be read if a storage medium is repurposed, returned, misplaced, or stolen.  Use hardware and software encryption to enable dual-layer protection.

NetApp Storage Encryption (NSE) supports hardware encryption using self-encrypting drives (SEDs).  SEDs encrypt data as it is written. Encrypted data can’t be read without the encryption key stored on the SED. Nodes attempting to read from an SED must be authenticated to access the encryption key.  Nodes are authenticated by obtaining an authentication key from a key manager.  Use the ASA r2 onboard key manager or an external key manager to serve authentication keys to your nodes.

In addition to NSE, you can also enable software encryption to add another layer of security to your data.

.Steps

. In System manager, select *Cluster > Settings*.
. In the *Security* section, under *Encryption*, select *Configure*.
. Configure the key manager.

Now that you have encrypted your data at rest, if you are using the NVMe/TCP protocol, you can link:nvme-tcp-connections.html[encrypt all the data sent over the network between your NVMe/TCP host and your ASA r].
