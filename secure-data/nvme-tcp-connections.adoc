If you are using the NVMe protocol, you can configure in-band authentication to enhance your data security.  In-band authentication allows secure bidirectional and unidirectional authentication between your NVMe hosts and your ASA r2 system. In-band authentication is available for all NVMe hosts.  If you are using the NVMe/TCP protocol, you can further enhance your data security by configuring transport layer security (TLS) to encrypt all data sent over the network between your NVMe/TCP hosts and your ASA r2 system.

.Steps

. Select *Hosts*; then select *NVMe*.
. Select image:icon_add_blue_bg.png[blue square with a plus sign followed by the word Add in white letters] .
. Enter the host name; then select the host operating system.
. Enter a host description; then select the storage VM to connect to the host.
. Select image:icon_dropdown_arrow.gif[blue downward facing arrow] next to the host name.
. Select *In-band authentication*.
. If you are using the NVMe/TCP protocol, select *Require Transport Layer Security (TLS)*.
. Select *Add*.

.Result

The security of your data is enhanced with in-band authentication and/or TLS.
