== Non-disruptive data migration

If you need to migrate your VM workload from an ASA storage system to an ASA r2 storage system, NetApp recommends that you use vSphere vMotion to perform a live, non-disruptively migration of your data. 

== Configure ASA r2 as a storage provider for VMware vSphere

OTV 10.3 EAP

== Connect non-VMware SAN clients
