You might need to reboot a node for maintenance, troubleshooting, software updates or other administrative reasons.  When a node is rebooted, its HA partner automatically executes a takeover, then performs an automatic giveback when the rebooted node comes back online.

.Steps

. From System Manager, select *Cluster > Overview*.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] next to the node you want to reboot; then select *Reboot*.
. Enter the reason you are rebooting the node; then select *Reboot*.

The reason you enter for the reboot is recorded in the system audit log.
