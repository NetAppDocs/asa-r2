== Add a broadcast domain

Use broadcast domains to simplify management of your cluster network by grouping network ports that belong to the same layer 2 network.  The ports in the group can then be used by storage virtual machines (VMs) for data or management traffic.

The “Default” broadcast domain and the “Cluster” broadcast domain are created during cluster initialization. The “Default” broadcast domain contains ports that are in the “Default” IPspace. These ports are used primarily to serve data. Cluster management and node management ports are also in this broadcast domain.  The “Cluster” broadcast domain contains ports that are in the “Cluster” IPspace.  These ports are used for cluster communication and include all cluster ports from all nodes in the cluster.

You can create additional broadcast domains after your cluster has been initialized.  Ports added to the broadcast domain can be physical ports, VLANs, or link aggregation groups/interface groups.  After ports are added to a broadcast domain, they can be used by storage VMs.

When you create a broadcast domain, a failover group that contains the same ports is automatically created.

[NOTE]
Ports can belong to only one broadcast domain.  If you want to add ports to a new broadcast domain belong to an existing broadcast domain, you must reassign the ports from the existing broadcast domain to the new broadcast domain.  

.About this task

The maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the ports added to a broadcast domain are updated to the MTU value set in the broadcast domain.

.Steps

.  From System Manager, select *Network > Overview*.
. Under *Broadcast* domains, select image:icon_add_blue_bg.gif[blue rectangle containing a plus sign followed by the word add in white letters].
. Enter a name for the broadcast domain or accept the default name.
+
All broadcast domain names must be unique within an IPspace.
. Select the IPspace for the broadcast domain.
+
If you don’t specify an IPspace name, the broadcast domain is created in the "Default" IPspace.
. Enter the maximum transmission unit (MTU).
+
MTU is the largest data packet that can be accepted in your broadcast domain.
. Select the desired ethernet ports; then select *Save*.

== Reassign ports to a different broadcast domain

If you want to change the broadcast domain to which a port belongs, you need to reassign the port from its existing broadcast domain to the new broadcast domain.

.Steps

. From System Manager, select *Network > Overview*.
. Under *Broadcast Domains*, select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] next to the domain name; then select *Edit*.
. Deselect the Ethernet ports that you want to reassign to another domain.
. Select the broadcast domain to which you want to reassign the port, then select *Reassign*.
. Select *Save*.


== Create a VLAN
Create a VLAN to maintain separate broadcast domains within the same network domain.

.Before you begin

The switches deployed in the network must either comply with IEEE 802.1Q standards or have a vendor-specific implementation of VLANs.

.About this task:

* A VLAN can’t be created on an interface group port that contains no member ports.
* When you configure a VLAN over a port for the first time, the port might go down, resulting in a temporary disconnection of the network. Subsequent VLAN additions to the same port do not affect the port state.
* You should not create a VLAN on a network interface with the same identifier as the native VLAN of the switch. For example, if the network interface e0b is on native VLAN 10, you should not create a VLAN e0b-10 on that interface.

.Steps

. From System Manager, select *Network > Ethernet* ports; then select image:icon_vlan.png[a blue plus sign followed by the word vlan].
. Select the node and broadcast domain for the VLAN.
. Select the port for the VLAN.
+
The VLAN can’t be attached to a port hosting a cluster LIF or to ports assigned to the cluster IPspace.  
. Enter a VLAN ID.
. Select *Save*.
