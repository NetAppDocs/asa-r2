:imagesdir: ../media/

[.lead]
Beginning in ONTAP 9.16.1 you can add additional HA pairs to your ASA r2 storage system. After the new nodes of an HA pair have been cabled and powered on, you need to join them to the cluster. 

.Before you begin

Gather the following information:

* The node IP address
* The intercluster network interface IP address
* The intercluster network subnet mask
* The intercluster network gateway
* If you want to configure the onboard key manager (OKM), you need the OKM passphrase.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster > Overview*.
. Select image:icon_kabob.gif[three vertical blue dots] next to the node you want to join to the cluster; then select *Add node*
. Enter the IP address for each node.
. Enter the intercluster network interface IP address, subnet mask, and gateway.
. If you want to configure the onboard key manager (OKM), enter the OKM passphrase.
+ 
*Configure onboard key manager for encryption* is selected by default. 
. Select *Add*.

.Result

The new HA pair is joined to the cluster.

.What's next?

After you add the new HA pair to the cluster, you can link:../install-setup/set-up-data-access.html[enable data access from your SAN hosts] to your new nodes.
