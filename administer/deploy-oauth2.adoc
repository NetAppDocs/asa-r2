[.lead]
OAuth 2.0 is the industry standard authorization framework. It is used to restrict and control access to protected resources using signed access tokens.  you have the option to control access to your ONTAP clusters using the Open Authorization (OAuth 2.0) framework. 

You need to configure the ONTAP cluster to enable and use OAuth 2.0. This includes establishing a connection to the authorization server and defining the required ONTAP authorization configuration.

.About this task

* The ONTAP implementation is designed to be compatible with any OAuth 2.0 compliant authorization server.
* You can define up to eight authorization servers for a single ONTAP cluster. This gives you the flexibility to meet the needs of your diverse security environment.
* You can configure ONTAP and the authorization servers to use Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) which strengthens client authentication. It guarantees the OAuth 2.0 access tokens are only used by the clients to which they were originally issued. 

== Step 1: Prepare for deployment

== Step 2: Install the authentication certificate
ONTAP includes a large number of pre-installed root CA certificates. So in many cases, the certificate for your authorization server will be immediately recognized by ONTAP without additional configuration. But depending on how the authorization server certificate was signed, you may need to install a root CA certificate and any intermediate certificates.

Follow the instructions provided below to install the certificate if it's needed. You should install all the required certificates at the cluster level.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster > Settings*.

. Under *Security*, next to *Certificates*, select image:icon_arrow.gif[blue arrow pointing to the right].

. Under *Trusted certificate authorities*, select *Add*.

. Select *Import*; then select the certificate file.

. Complete the configuration parameters for your environment.

. Select *Add*.


== Step 3: Configure the authorization server

== Step 4: Enable OAuth 2.0
The final step is to enable OAuth 2.0. This is a global setting for the cluster.

[CAUTION]
Don't enable OAuth 2.0 processing until you confirm that ONTAP, the authorization servers, and any supporting services have all been properly configured.

.Steps

. In System Manager, select *Cluster > Settings*.

. Under *Security*,  section next to *OAuth 2.0 authorization*, select image:icon_arrow.gif[blue arrow pointing to the right].

. Enable *OAuth 2.0 authorization*.
