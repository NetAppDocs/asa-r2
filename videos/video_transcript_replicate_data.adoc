You can use ONTAP System Manager to protect your data by scheduling snapshots of your storage units or consistency groups and replicating to a remote location.  

In this example weâ€™ll schedule snapshots for existing storage units.  

From the System Manager menu, select *Storage*.  

Select the storage unit you want to protect, then select *Protect*. 

You can optionally create an on-demand snapshot by selecting *Add a snapshot now*. 

Under *Remote protection*, select *replicate to a remote cluster*. 

Select the storage VM and replication policy for replication.  By default, the initial data transfer will begin immediately.  

Select *Save*.  

If the storage unit is not in a consistency group, you must create one.  Enter a name for the new consistency group, then select *Create*. 

You have quickly and easily replicated your consistency group to a remote cluster.
