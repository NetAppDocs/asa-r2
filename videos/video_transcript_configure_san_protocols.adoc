You can use ONTAP System Manager to quickly and easily configure your SAN protocols.  In this example weâ€™ll configure IP addresses for iSCSI network interfaces.

From the System Manager dashboard, select *Configure protocols*. 

Under *IP*, select *Configure IP interfaces*, then select *Add a subnet*.  

Enter a name for the subnet, then enter the subnet IP addresses. 

Enter the subnet mask, and optionally enter a gateway; then select *Add*. 

Select the subnet you just created; then select *Save*.  

You have just easily and quickly configured IP address for iSCSI network interfaces.
